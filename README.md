An effort to learn Django Rest Framework
----------------------------------------

Christian and I need to understand the relative endpoints

By documenting the sets taken, and producting working code
with both of these frameworks, we hope to take our learnings
and apply them to the prophet framework.

Notes on DRF are kept in a google doc, like so:
